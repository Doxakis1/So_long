This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

This was my first graphic project and I am by no means a good a game designer or graphics designer. The game goal is simple. You are playing the main
character Jack the Pirate. Your island has got invaded by enemies. U must defeat the enemies by reaching them and then go to your treasure burial marked
with an X on the map:

Once all enemies have been defeated, you win and can exit the map!

The game uses WSAD for movement and ESC will close the game. Like mentioned this project was all about testing the waters with graphics, more epic
projects coming soon!
